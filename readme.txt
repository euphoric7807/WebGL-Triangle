#Administrative - Book citation 
"Image-space algorithms works as part of the projection process
and seek to determine the relationship among object points on each
projector. The z-buffer algorithm is of the latter type and fits in well 
with the rendering pipeline in most graphics systems because because we
can save partial information as each object is rendered."

#Tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB0ZVUrI4Aw&t=1635s&ab_channel=IndigoCode
I think this explanation is very good. The only issue for me was the speed and the 
audio quality. 
Furthermore I read through this website: https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fundamentals.html
to understand the things that weren't that well explained in the youtube video. It also provided a step by step
detailed explanation on everything in a simple way. I think the best way to follow the
youtube tutorial is to also read the website parallel to it. The problem with the website is 
that you don't really see how to handle errors while the youtube tutorial provides a couple 

of error handling methods.
